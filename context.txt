You are generating a React Native + Expo + Firebase MVP for “Atheracare,” a senior health and family connection app. No AI features in v1. Use TypeScript.

### Scope
Build an MVP with:
- Auth (email/password) with Firebase
- Senior role screens: Home, Meds, Hydration, Activity, Settings
- Family role screens: Feed, Member, Settings
- Family invite flow with invite codes
- Local notifications for medication schedules
- Push notifications for family reactions and simple alerts
- Firestore data model and security rules
- Cloud Functions for push notifications and simple alert checks

### Tech Choices
- Expo SDK 51+, React Native, TypeScript
- Navigation: @react-navigation/native + stack and bottom-tabs
- Notifications: expo-notifications (local), FCM via Expo push for remote
- Firebase: Auth, Firestore, Storage, Cloud Functions
- Date handling: date-fns

### Commands and project setup
- Create project with create-expo-app
- Install deps:
  - @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack @react-navigation/bottom-tabs react-native-safe-area-context react-native-screens
  - zustand react-hook-form zod react-native-paper
  - expo-notifications expo-sensors expo-constants expo-image-picker
  - firebase
  - date-fns
- Add minimal `app.json` and permissions for notifications and media
- Add `firebase.ts` initializer that reads config from env

### Navigation
- AuthStack: Welcome, SignIn, SignUp, JoinFamily
- SeniorTabs: Home, Meds, Hydration, Activity, Settings
- FamilyTabs: Feed, Member, Settings
- Implement a simple role router: after login, load user doc and route to SeniorTabs or FamilyTabs.

### Firestore data model
Collections with fields:
- users/{userId}: displayName, role ("senior" | "family"), photoURL, timezone, familyId, shareDefaults: { shareWinsOnly: true }
- families/{familyId}: name, createdBy, inviteCode
- memberships/{uid_familyId}: userId, familyId, role, createdAt
- medications/{medId}: ownerId, name, dosage, schedule: { times: ["08:00","20:00"], daysOfWeek: [0-6] }, active
- medLogs/{logId}: ownerId, medId, takenAt, source, sharedToFamily
- hydrationGoals/{goalId}: ownerId, ouncesPerDay, updatedAt
- hydrationLogs/{logId}: ownerId, date: "YYYY-MM-DD", totalOz, increments: [{oz, at}]
- activityDaily/{docId}: ownerId, date: "YYYY-MM-DD", steps
- shares/{shareId}: familyId, ownerId, type: "med" | "water" | "steps" | "photo" | "voice", payload, createdAt
- reactions/{reactionId}: shareId, userId, type: "emoji" | "text", text?, createdAt
- alerts/{alertId}: familyId, ownerId, kind, createdAt, status

Create composite indexes if needed for familyId + createdAt on shares.

### Security Rules
Write Firestore security rules:
- users readable/writable only by the owner
- medications, medLogs, hydration*, activityDaily readable/writable by the owner
- shares readable by family members in the same familyId
- reactions readable by family members of the share’s familyId and creatable by signed-in users
- alerts readable by family members of the familyId, created by Cloud Functions or signed-in users
- helper function `isFamilyMemberOf(familyId)` checks existence of memberships doc `${uid}_${familyId}`

### Features and acceptance criteria

1) Onboarding and Auth
- Sign up with email/password
- Choose role: senior or family
- If family: can create a family or join with invite code
- If senior: can create a family, then invite code is generated

2) Senior Home
- Shows three cards: Meds today, Hydration progress, Steps today
- Each card has a primary action
- After any success, show “Share this win” and on tap create a `shares` doc with type "med" | "water" | "steps"

3) Medications
- List, create, edit, delete
- Schedule: times per day and optional daysOfWeek
- On save, schedule local notifications using expo-notifications (device local time)
- When the user taps “I took it,” create a medLogs doc and update streak locally
- Option to share the success to family (creates a shares doc)

4) Hydration
- Set a daily goal in oz
- Quick add buttons for 4, 8, 16 oz increments
- Show progress ring and total for today
- Share completion when goal reached

5) Activity
- Read steps from expo-sensors pedometer
- Store steps snapshot for the day in activityDaily
- Show weekly bar chart (can be simple rectangles, no library needed)
- Share when a daily target is hit (default 3,000 steps for MVP)

6) Family Feed
- Show list of shares for the family ordered by createdAt desc
- Each item supports reactions (emoji or short text)
- On reaction create, Cloud Function sends a push to the senior if share.ownerId != reactor uid

7) Alerts (simple)
- Cloud Function runs every 2 hours:
  - If no medLogs in the last X hours for an active med schedule, create an alert doc and push to family
  - If activityDaily.steps < Y by 6 pm local time, create low_activity alert
- Senior can opt out by a flag in users.shareDefaults

8) Push notifications
- Register for push tokens on both roles and store on users doc
- Use Expo push service or FCM to notify:
  - Senior when a family reaction is posted
  - Family when an alert is created

### UI and accessibility
- Font size 18pt base with in-app scaler to 24pt
- Buttons min height 48 with large hit slop
- High contrast colors
- Clear labels, no clutter

### Files to generate
- package.json with all deps
- app.json with name, scheme, permissions for notifications
- src/firebase.ts
- src/state/store.ts (Zustand)
- src/types.ts for shared types and Firestore converters
- src/navigation/AuthStack.tsx, SeniorTabs.tsx, FamilyTabs.tsx, RoleRouter.tsx
- src/screens/auth/{Welcome,SignIn,SignUp,JoinFamily}.tsx
- src/screens/senior/{Home,Meds,MedsEdit,Hydration,Activity,Settings}.tsx
- src/screens/family/{Feed,Member,Settings}.tsx
- src/components/{Card,ProgressRing,ShareButton}.tsx
- src/utils/{dates.ts, notifications.ts, pedometer.ts}
- functions/src/index.ts with triggers:
  - onCreate(reactions) -> push to senior
  - scheduled function for alerts
- firestore.rules covering the model above
- README.md with setup instructions

### Config and placeholders
- Do not include secrets in code. Read Firebase config from env or app.json extras.
- Provide example .env.example
- Give a seed script or instructions to create a fake family and fake data for local testing.

### Testing checklist (MVP manual)
- Can sign up as senior, create family, add med, receive local notification, confirm dose, see win, share it, and see it appear on a family account.
- Can set hydration goal, add water, reach goal, share win.
- Pedometer shows steps and stores daily value.
- Family can react and senior receives a push.
- Scheduled function creates an alert when rules are met.

Generate all files with complete, runnable code, and note any Expo prebuild steps if a library needs it. Keep imports valid for Expo managed workflow and avoid non-Expo native modules.


lets go finally its working. the medication is being saved in firebase. now fix the hydration tracker and make sure its also being saved in firebase. but i just wanna say that before we do that that this entire app layout has to be changed and that might change the code and mess with the firebase if things arent connected so ill break it down here so basically when the app first opens, Slides 0–2: Warm intro (no inputs)

0: “Welcome to atheracare.” One line about helping with meds, water, steps, and simple family updates.

1: “Big buttons. Clear text. Gentle reminders.”

2: “You choose what to share. You’re in control.”

Slides 3–10: Quick setup (tap-to-choose)

Short, single question per screen with 2–4 large options. Back and Skip are always visible.

Progress indicator (e.g., “3 of 10”).

Slides 11–13: Family + permissions

Family joining/creating (optional now, can do later).

Ask for notification permission only after the user chooses reminders.

Motion permission (steps) only if they enable activity tracking.

Finish

Confirmation screen shows what’s set. “Done” → Home screen. Background tasks schedule notifications and write defaults.

2) The questions (make them up, simple choices)

Each bullet shows: Question → Choices → Key saved → What it triggers.

What should we call you?

Free text or pick from device name

profile.displayName → personalize copy

Text size that’s comfortable?

Small / Medium / Large / Extra Large

prefs.textScale → set global font scale

Contrast style?

Standard / High Contrast

prefs.contrast → theme selection

Do you want medication reminders?

Yes / Not now

med.enabled → show or hide meds card; if Yes, ask Q5–6

How many times do you take meds most days?

Once / Twice / Three times

med.timesPerDay → prefill schedule UI

Pick times for reminders

Chips for common times (8:00am, 12:00pm, 8:00pm) or custom time picker

med.schedule.times[] → schedule local notifications

Daily water goal

4 cups (32 oz) / 6 cups (48 oz) / 8 cups (64 oz) / Custom

water.goalOz → progress ring target

How do you log water?

4 oz / 8 oz / 16 oz quick buttons

water.quickIncrements[] → UI buttons

Track steps with this phone?

Yes / Not now

activity.enabled → pedometer start; ask permission later

Daily step goal

2,000 / 3,000 / 5,000 / Custom

activity.dailyGoal

Quiet hours (silence reminders at night)?

9pm–7am / 10pm–8am / Off / Custom

prefs.quietHours → notification scheduling window

Share wins with family?

Yes, share wins / Not now

sharing.shareWins → enables “auto-share after success” prompt

Connect with family now or later?

Create family / Join with code / Do this later

family.mode + family.id or inviteCode → sets up feed

How do you want reminders to feel?

Gentle chime / Standard alert / Vibrate only

prefs.reminderStyle → notification channel/sound

Backup & privacy

“Save to my account” (default) / “Keep on this phone only”

prefs.syncMode → whether to write to Firestore immediately or after sign-in

You can add or drop a couple, but this set keeps it quick and useful.

3) What happens behind the scenes

After each answer, save to local state; only write to Firestore once the user signs in or chooses “Save to my account.”

When med.schedule.times is set and user allows notifications, schedule local notifications for those times, respecting quiet hours.

When activity.enabled is true and motion permission granted, start pedometer listener and initialize today’s steps doc.

If sharing.shareWins is true and a family is linked, auto-prompt “Share this win?” after a med confirmation, water goal reach, or step goal reach.

If the user creates a family, generate a 6–8 char invite code, write a families doc, and store users.familyId.

4) Permissions timing (Expo)

Notifications: Ask after the user opts into reminders (Q4), not on app launch.

Motion (Pedometer): Ask after they enable activity tracking (Q9).

Media (Photos/Audio): Ask only when they first try to share a photo/voice note in the feed, not during onboarding.

keep this in mind okay. u dont need to build this right now but im just saying and also to keep in in mind. there is going tobe a menu in the bottom with different things

Bottom menu (tabs)
