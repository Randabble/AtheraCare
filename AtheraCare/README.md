# AtheraCare - Development Environment

This is the development environment setup for AtheraCare, a senior health and family connection app built with React Native, Expo, and Firebase.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g @expo/cli`)
- Expo Go app on your mobile device

### Installation

1. **Clone and navigate to the project:**
   ```bash
   cd AtheraCare
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Test on your device:**
   - Open Expo Go on your phone
   - Scan the QR code from the terminal
   - The test app will load and you can verify all functionality

## ðŸ“± Testing the Development Environment

The current app is a **test environment** that verifies all installed packages and functionality:

### What's Being Tested:
- âœ… **React Navigation** - Navigation between screens
- âœ… **React Native Paper** - UI components and theming
- âœ… **Safe Area Context** - Proper screen boundaries
- âœ… **Expo Sensors** - Pedometer functionality
- âœ… **Expo Notifications** - Local notifications
- âœ… **Expo Image Picker** - Camera and photo library access
- âœ… **Date-fns** - Date formatting utilities
- âœ… **TypeScript** - Type checking and IntelliSense

### Test Features:
1. **Navigation Test** - Verifies React Navigation is working
2. **UI Components Test** - Tests React Native Paper buttons and cards
3. **Pedometer Test** - Checks step counting functionality
4. **Notifications Test** - Tests permission requests and local notifications
5. **Image Picker Test** - Tests camera roll access
6. **Date-fns Test** - Tests date formatting
7. **Environment Status** - Overall system check

- Proper permissions for notifications, camera, and activity recognition
- Health data access permissions for iOS
- Android permissions for sensors and storage
- Expo plugins for notifications and image picker

### TypeScript
- Full TypeScript support with strict type checking
- Proper type definitions for all dependencies

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist

Before proceeding with the main app development, verify:

- [ ] App loads without errors
- [ ] Navigation works smoothly
- [ ] UI components render correctly
- [ ] Pedometer shows step count (if available on device)
- [ ] Notification permissions can be requested
- [ ] Test notifications can be sent
- [ ] Image picker can access photo library
- [ ] Date formatting works correctly
- [ ] All TypeScript types are valid

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Metro bundler issues:**
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

2. **Dependency conflicts:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

3. **Expo Go connection issues:**
   - Ensure phone and computer are on same network
   - Try switching between tunnel, LAN, and localhost modes

4. **Permission issues:**
   - Grant permissions when prompted
   - Check device settings for app permissions

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

Once the test environment is verified working:

1. **Firebase Setup** - Configure Firebase project and add credentials
2. **App Structure** - Create the main app navigation and screens
3. **Authentication** - Implement Firebase Auth
4. **Database** - Set up Firestore collections and security rules
5. **Features** - Build senior and family role features

## ðŸ›  Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm start

# Start on Android
npm run android

# Start on iOS (requires macOS)
npm run ios

# Start on web
npm run web

# Clear cache and restart
npx expo start --clear
```

## ðŸ“± Device Testing

### Physical Device (Recommended):
- Install Expo Go from App Store/Google Play
- Scan QR code from terminal
- Test all features including sensors and notifications

### Simulator/Emulator:
- iOS Simulator (macOS only)
- Android Emulator
- Some features like pedometer may not work in simulators

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes

- Firebase configuration will be added via environment variables
- No sensitive data is currently in the codebase
- Permissions are properly configured for production use
